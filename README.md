# Quicksort
A basic implementation of the quicksort algorithm in python. May update to get the pivot randomly instead of just the median of the high, low, and mid

Edit: my b y'all I fucked it up. Sorry to all the fans of the mattx245 github profile

Edit 2: it works now guys. changed the pivot to last value though to make the whole thing elss complicated
